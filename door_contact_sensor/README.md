# Lock Door with Retry Limit and Custom Timeouts

![Lock Icon](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/50/000000/lock.png)

## Overview

**Lock Door with Retry Limit and Custom Timeouts** is a Home Assistant automation blueprint designed to ensure your door remains securely locked. If the door fails to stay closed, the automation will attempt to lock it multiple times (up to a defined retry limit). After exceeding the maximum retries, it can send you a notification, allowing you to take further action. This blueprint offers customizable timeouts and integrates seamlessly with your existing Home Assistant setup.

## Features

- **Automatic Locking:** Ensures your door is locked whenever it's unlocked.
- **Retry Mechanism:** Attempts to re-lock the door multiple times if it doesn't stay closed.
- **Customizable Timeouts:** Define how long to wait for the door to close and verify its state.
- **Notifications:** Receive alerts after exceeding retry limits.
- **Counter Integration:** Keeps track of retry attempts using Home Assistant Helpers.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Easily adjust parameters to fit your specific needs.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up this automation, ensure you have the following:

- **Home Assistant:** Installed and running. ([Installation Guide](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/))
- **Lock Device:** A compatible smart lock integrated with Home Assistant.
- **Door Sensor:** A binary sensor (e.g., door/window sensor) that detects open/closed states.
- **Helpers:** Ability to create and manage Helpers in Home Assistant.

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lock-door-automation.git
   ```
2. **Add the Blueprint:**
  - Navigate to your Home Assistant configuration directory.
  - Place the `lock_door_with_retry.yaml` file into the `blueprints/automation/` directory. If the directories don't exist, create them.
`mkdir -p /config/blueprints/automation/lock_door/`
`cp lock_door_with_retry.yaml /config/blueprints/automation/lock_door/`
3. **Create the Counter Helper:**
  - Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services** > **Helpers** in your Home Assistant UI.
  - Click **Add Helper** and choose **Counter**.
  - Name the counter `door_lock_retries` (this is the default name used by the blueprint).

## Configuration
### Blueprint Inputs
When adding the automation, you'll need to configure the following inputs:

| Input | Description | Type | Default |
|----|----|----|----|
| `door_lock` | The lock device to control. | Lock entity | *None* |
| `door_sensor` | The door sensor to monitor (must detect open/closed states). | Binary sensor | *None* |
| `counter_variable` | The counter variable created using Helpers. | Text | `counter.door_lock_retries` |
| `max_retries` | The maximum number of attempts to lock the door before sending a notification. | Number (1-10) | `3` |
| `enable_notification` | Whether to send a notification after reaching the maximum retry attempts. | Boolean | `false` |
| `notification_device`	 | The notification service to use (e.g., notify.mobile_app_your_device). | Text | `""` (empty string) |
| `door_close_timeout` | Time to wait for the door to close initially, in seconds. | Number (5-120) | `30` |
| `verification_timeout` | Time to ensure the door remains closed, in seconds. | Number (5-120) | `30` |

### Steps to Configure
1. **Add the Automation:**
  - In Home Assistant, go to **Settings** > **Automations & Scenes** > **Blueprints**.
  - Select **Import Blueprint** and enter the `lock_door_with_retry.yaml` url, `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garnser/homeassistant-blueprints/refs/heads/main/sector_door_contact_sensor/sector_door_contact_sensor.yaml`.
  - Fill in the required inputs as per your setup.
2. **Configure Each Input:**
  - **Door Lock:** Select your smart lock entity (e.g., `lock.front_door`).
  - **Door Sensor:** Select your door sensor entity (e.g., `binary_sensor.front_door`).
  - **Counter Variable:** Use the default `counter.door_lock_retries` or specify another if you created a different helper.
  - **Max Retries:** Set the number of retry attempts (default is `3`).
  - **Enable Notification:** Toggle to `true` if you want to receive notifications.
  - **Notification Device:** Specify your notification service (e.g., `notify.mobile_app_your_device`). Leave empty to use the default `notify.notify`.
  - **Door Close Timeout:** Set the initial wait time for the door to close (default is `30` seconds).
  - **Verification Timeout:** Set the time to verify the door remains closed (default is `30` seconds).
3. **Save the Automation:**
  - After configuring all inputs, save the automation. It will now be active and ready to monitor your door lock.

## Usage
Once installed and configured, the automation works as follows:

1. **Trigger:** When the specified door lock changes to the "unlocked" state.
2. **Retry Mechanism:**
  - Checks if the retry count has reached the maximum limit (`max_retries`).
  - If the limit is reached and notifications are enabled, it sends a notification.
  - Resets the retry counter.
  - If the limit is not reached, it increments the retry counter.
3. **Door Monitoring:**
  - Waits for the door to close within the `door_close_timeout` period.
  - If the door doesn't close in time, the automation restarts.
4. Verification:
  - After the door closes, it waits for the `verification_timeout` to ensure the door remains closed.
  - If the door reopens during verification, the automation restarts.
  - If the door stays closed, it locks the door and resets the counter.

**Automation Mode:** `restart` â€“ ensures that the automation restarts its sequence if triggered again while already running.
